### About
Topguw is a small piece of software that I made to help people who want to analyse and then crack GSM. 
Topguw works with airprobe and kalibrate-rtl. 
It takes some steps of the know-plaintext attack vector to GSM automatically (Karsten Nohl).

The actual version is currently in beta, bugs may occur but the software will work with good input data.
V0.1

## How to install
1. Dependencies 
  -  First, you have to install airprobe and gsmframecoder, (airprobe depends on gnu-radio **3.6**, so if you use Kali 2 for example you have 2 solutions -> downgrade to kali 1 or use the zmiana patch).
  -  You should install kalibrate-rtl too (Topguw uses kal command to scan GSM tower).
  -  Not really a dependencies, just to tell you that I use Oracle JDK 8 to run Topguw.

2. Run
  -  From a shell, you can start the jar with "java -jar topguw_git.jar" 
  -  Use Netbean to import the project and run from Netbean, main class is Principal.java

### Topguw v2 development is being started, code and more informations available here : https://github.com/bastienjalbert/topguw2

Topguw v1 is really dirty, this API will easily perform gsm analysis in Java and make application creation possible for anybody on the gsm protocol. If you want to help me : contact me, you can find sources here https://github.com/bastienjalbert/topguw_api/ .
